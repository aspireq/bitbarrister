                                        Bitcoins are units of electronic currency. They are similar to gold, in that they can be mined, valued and exchanged for other currencies. However, the only tool needed for Bitcoin mining is the power of a computer. The rate of Bitcoin mining is measured in MHash/s (millions hashes per second). It is not possible to mine Bitcoins on a standard PC, as the process requires specially optimized computing solutions.
